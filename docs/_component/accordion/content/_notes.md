The most important thing to remember when implementing this accordion is that the trigger (the element you click to open a drawer) needs to be a focusable element. In this case, we’re using a button and applying all the ARIA attributes with JavaScript. If JavaScript isn’t enabled, each drawer will be in its natural open state.

<ul class="button-group button-group--flush">

</ul>
