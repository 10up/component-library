## Installation

`npm install @10up/animate --save`

## Usage

#### CSS Imports

`@import url("@10up/animate");`

The standard import from the NPM package will bring in all the animations. If
you want to choose the animations to bring in you can do so manually by
referencing the CSS files directly.

### CSS

 The styles can be imported into your existing codebase by using PostCSS imports, or by including the standalone CSS file in your project.
