## Installation

[View official documentation for this package](https://baseline.10up.com/component/countdown-timer)

### Markup

 This is the markup template expected by the component. To count down to midnight on New Year's Day in the year 2046 in your local time zone:

 ```html
<time class="countdown-timer" datetime="2046-01-01T00:00:00">
	<!-- Some fallback content, perhaps the date string itself or a message to users or machines that can't view this component with JS. -->
</time>
 ```

### Usage

 Create a new instance by supplying the selector to use for the component and an object containing any necessary callback functions.

```javascript
import CountdownTimer from '@10up/countdown-timer';

new CountdownTimer( '.countdown-timer', {
	// Settings and callback properties go here.
} );
```
